## ⚙️ Steps to Set Up Locally  

### Prerequisites  
- Install **Node.js** (for React)  
- Install **Python 3.x** (for Django)  
- Install **PostgreSQL** (if running locally, as Supabase uses PostgreSQL)  

### Backend Setup (Django)

2. Install Python dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  
3. Set up environment variables:

4. Run database migrations:  
   ```bash  
   python manage.py migrate  
   ```  
5. Start the backend server:  
   ```bash  
   python manage.py runserver  
   ```  

### Frontend Setup (React)

   cd ../frontend  
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash  
   npm install  
   ```  
3. Start the React development server:  
   ```bash
